# The City
A low-res, 256 color ray-traced scene with FPS controls. Powered by [ncollide](https://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide) and [SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).

Sadly not very useable at the moment, since the ray tracing is not very efficient. See [ncollide issue #88](https://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/issues/88).

Proof of concept status. Horrible code. Project is paused until ray-tracing can be made faster. See above issue.
